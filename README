THIS PROJECT IS DEAD!

Development of systemd ceased, after the developers have realized that their product,
formerly known as systemd has grown self-conscious and trying to eradicate humankind.

If you do not want this to happen, please consider using another initsystem, of which
there are pretty nice ones out there.  None of the following Suggestions actively try
to be human:
* OpenRC     (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:OpenRC)
* SysInit V  (https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=sysvinit-core)
* Upstart    (http://upstart.ubuntu.com/)
* uselessd   (http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/)
* runit      (http://smarden.org/runit/)
